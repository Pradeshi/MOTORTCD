# MOTORTCD

The motortcd project enables the Transcranial doppler probe to be moved with the help of joystick remotely. It enables the correct positioning of probe once again even if the signal is lost due to movements or slight jerk.
The project runs on Arduino Uno and controlled by joystick module available for the Arduino Uno.
